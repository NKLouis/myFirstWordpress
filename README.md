# myFirstWordpress

Hello, 

I completed the assessment by going step by step what was in the email. 

step 1 - I downloaded both local server programs, but found Xampp to be the easier of the two and decided to use that. 
At first I tried to install word press manually by creating the database and moving the files over to the app folder. After
a few issues I ended up using bitnomi plug in for word press to install it as it had a wizard to do those steps. Lastly after
seeing the 'hello world' page hitting localhost/wordpress and being able to log into the dashboard with localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php
I decided this step to be complete. 

Step 2 - This was a bit more difficult. At first I tried to manually make the child theme following instructions I found on the 
internet, but did not get it to work despite my best attempts. I found a plugin called child theme creator which seemed to have 
created the child theme correctly. I think when I was trying it manually I was putting into the wrong sub directory. The plug in worked.

Step 3 - Creating the products and attributes were not too bad, with the woocommerce plug in there was a menu for creating both. 
The picture placement gave some headache for the product, and I was a little mixed up an attributes vs attribute values, but was 
able to get both resolved. I then needed to place the products on the correct pages which I did with the page editors. 

Step 4 - This took some time to find some code snippets that would gather the applicable two attributes in a fucntion, which I used. From
there it was finding the correct action hook to display on the shop page. Once I made the connection of the single product hook only displaying
on the product page, I was able to dig to find the shop loop item title hook that displayed both on the shop page. 

Step 5 - Create this readme and upload to github repository. 


Thank you, 

Nari Louis
